# Data Cleaning/ Preparation 
## in the initial data preparation phase . We performed the following tasks
1.	Data loading and inspection 
2.	Handling missing values
3.	Data cleaning and formatting 
# Exploration Data Analysis (EDA)
## EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer question, such as 
-	What is the overall sales trend?
-	Which products are top seller?
-	What are the peak sales periods?
# Data Analysis 
## include some interesting code/ features worked with
~~~ SQL
Select*from table1
Where cond = 2; ~~~

# Results/Finding 
## the analysis results are summarized as follows:-
1.	The company’s sales have been increasing over the last years, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season 
2.	Product category A is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue 
3.	Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targetd for marketing efforts.

# Recommendations 
## Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions 
-	Invest in marketing and promotion during peak sales season to maximize revenue 
-	Focus on expanding and promoting product category A
-	Implement a customer segmentation strategy to get high LTV customers effectively 

# Limitation 
## I have to remove all zeros value from budget and revenue column because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outlines even after commissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
